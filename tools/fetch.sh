# The Bouffalo SDK's master branch has moved on from what this firmware
# was written against in 2024: struct usbh_hid lost report_desc and
# usbh_initialize() grew arguments, so mnano/usb_host.c will not compile.
# master_legacy still carries the old CherryUSB API.  Its history does not
# reach back to 2024 either, so this is the closest thing to the right
# vintage that can still be fetched.
